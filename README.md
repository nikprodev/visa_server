# visa_server

This Python script runs in a Windows environment and communicates with the PPMS/VersaLab (Quantum Design) device via the MultiVu software. It provides a standard VISA interface over the TCP/IP protocol. Additional devices can be integrated into the server to expose them through the VISA protocol; for example, support for a LinkBone switching matrix backend has been added.

The program requires Python 3 (version â‰¤ 3.12) and the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pywin32/">pywin32</a> extension to access Windows API functions. Also, for the server to work, the _rpcbind_ portmapper service is required, which can be launched in a WSL Linux virtual environment.

To send requests to the server, you can use the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/PyVISA/">pyvisa</a> package with the Python backend <a href="https://pypi.org/project/PyVISA-py/">pyvisa-pi</a>. For example, to request device identification:
```
import pyvisa
rm = pyvisa.ResourceManager()
inst = rm.open_resource("TCPIP0::127.0.0.1::inst0")
print(inst.query("*IDN?"))

> 'Quantum Design,PPMSVersaLab,XXXXXX,V1.0.6.4\r\n'
```
