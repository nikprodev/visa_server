# visa_server

## Description

This Python script, based on the <a href="https://github.com/coburnw/python-vxi11-server">vxi11-server</a> code, runs in
a Windows environment and communicates with the PPMS/VersaLab (Quantum Design) device via the MultiVu software. It
provides a standard VISA interface over the TCP/IP protocol. Additional devices can be integrated into the server to
expose them through the VISA protocol; for example, support for a LinkBone switching matrix backend has been added.

The program requires Python 3 (version â‰¤ 3.12) and the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/pywin32/">pywin32</a> extension
to access Windows API functions. Also, for the server to work, the _rpcbind_ portmapper service is required, which can
be launched in a WSL Linux virtual environment.

## Client

To send requests to the server, you can use the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/PyVISA/">pyvisa</a> package with the
Python backend <a href="https://pypi.org/project/PyVISA-py/">pyvisa-py</a>. For example, to request device
identification:

```
import pyvisa
rm = pyvisa.ResourceManager()
inst = rm.open_resource("TCPIP0::127.0.0.1::inst0")
print(inst.query("*IDN?"))
```

_Output:_

```
'Quantum Design,PPMSVersaLab,XXXXXX,V1.0.6.4\r\n'
```

## Versalab queries

### Temperature

**Get temperature:**

```
TEMP?
```

_Output:_

```
'0,300.0,"K",1,"Stable"\r\n'
```

Format: *return_code, value, units, state_code, state_description*

States:

| Code | State                   |
|------|-------------------------|
| 1    | Stable                  |

| 13   | Diagnostic              |
| 14   | Impedance Control Error |
| 15   | General Failure         |

**Set temperature:**

```
TEMP 320.5, 20, 0
```

_Output:_

```
'OK\r\n'
```

Format: *value, rate, mode*\
_value_ is set in "K", _rate_ is set in "K/min" (max. 20)

Modes:

| Code | Mode         |
|------|--------------|
| 0    | Fast Settle  |
| 1    | No Overshoot |

## Instrument development

Additional instruments can be added as packages in the `backend/base` folder, inheriting from the _BaseDevice_ class.
Device parameters such as Manufacturer, Model, IP address, and others can be defined in the `__init__.py` file.
